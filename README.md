# AWS Cloud Security Projects

This repository contains my hands-on AWS projects focused on cloud security, automation, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). Each project is stored in its own subfolder and includes a full write-up, code, security principles applied, and lessons learned.

These projects demonstrate practical skills in:
- Terraform & automation
- IAM identity and access management
- Secure configuration and cloud hardening
- Threat reduction and cloud governance
