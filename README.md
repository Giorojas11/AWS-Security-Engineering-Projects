# AWS Security Engineering

This repository documents a production-oriented AWS Security Engineering program designed to demonstrate real-world cloud security skills across governance, prevention, detection, response, and resilience.

Rather than a single monolithic lab, this project is composed of domain-focused mini projects. Each mini project is independently valuable, and produces artifacts suitable for portfolio review, technical interviews, and certification alignment.

All infrastructure is built exclusively with Terraform, following least-privilege, infrastructure-as-code, and security-by-design principles.

## Program Goals

- Build enterprise-grade AWS security architecture from the ground up.
- Demonstrate security engineering decision-making, not just service usage.
- Generate real detection and incident response telemetry.
- Validate controls through intentional attack simulation.
- Produce a reviewable, defensible portfolio aligned with industry roles.

This program is intentionally designed to mirror how modern cloud security environments are built and operated.
